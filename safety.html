			Before building your PC, it is important to ground yourself and get rid of all static electricity you may have. This can be done by using an anti-static wrist or ankle strap. These are very cheap, usually around 5 to 8 dollars. You can also just place your PSU in the case, plug it in, donâ€™t turn it on. Touch the metal of your case every now and again, and DO NOT build on carpet. When the motherboard is out of the case, keep on top of the box it came in as it is anti-static.
