		  <h1>Random Access Memory (RAM)</h1>
				RAM is the temporary storage for the computer. Basically the working memory. Nothing is permanently stored there. The more RAM you have, the better the system will run. For gaming, 16gb of RAM is good enough for virtually all games. Most motherboards have 4 RAM slots some have more, or even less. Some extreme systems can have a whole terabyte! Another thig to consider with Ram is the memory speed. Memory speed is how long it takes for RAM to recieve a request from the processor and then read or write data. The maximum rated clock see for DDR4 RAM 2400 MHz. This can also be overclocke by the manufacturer. DDR4 RAM is the newest verson of RAM. There is rally no point in gettig earlier versions as they are not good for modern PC standards. Corsair, G.Skill, Kingston and Team Group, are all good brands for RAM. A good option for budget friendly high quality RAM, is the Corsair Vengeace Series of RAM. It comes in different speeds and colors, and there is an RGB version for they style points.<br>
