				<h1>Power Supply (PSU)</h1><br>

				The PSU is a necessary component to all PC’s because, well, it gives power to your system and without it, it’s not going to turn on. Depending on your system, you will need a different amount of wattage, make sure to get a PSU with more wattage than needed to be safe. For example, if your systems toal wattage is 398 watts, don't get a 400 watt power supply, go a little higher. It is also good to get more wattage than necessary if you plan on upgrading other components in the future. To check the wattage of your system, you can go to a variety of websites, select the parts you are using, and it will give an estimated wattage.

When it comes to buying a PSU, avoid buying cheap third party off brand PSUs. This could be potentially dangerous as getting a faulty PSU can damage your other components and could cause a fire, which would damage a lot more. Some reliable PSU brands are EVGA, Corsair, Seasonic, Silverstone, or Cooler Master. There are others, but these are the most popular.
